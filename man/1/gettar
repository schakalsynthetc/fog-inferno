.SH DESCRIPTION
These commands manage POSIX.1 tar archives in Inferno.
.PP
.I Gettar
reads a tar file from standard input and unpacks the contents into the current directory tree.
.PP
.I Lstar
reads a tar file from standard input and lists the files contained therein,
one per line, with four space-separated fields giving the file name, modification time (in seconds since the epoch),
size (in bytes), and a constant 0 (the place holder for a checksum).
The format is the same as that produced by
.B "du -n -t" .
.PP
.I Puttar
writes a tar file to standard output that contains each
.IR file ,
and its substructure if it is a directory.
Given no arguments,
.I puttar
instead reads a list of file names from standard input and includes
each file or directory named; it does not copy directory substructure.
.SH EXAMPLE
The following commands create a tar file with two files
.B test.b
and
.BR srv.b :
.IP
.EX
$ cat tarlist
test.b
srv.b
$ puttar <tarlist >test.tar
$ lstar <test.tar
test.b 867178082 1104 0
srv.b 866042662 3865 0
