pregexp is a portable implementation of regular
expressions (regexps) that runs in any R5RS- or
R4RS-compliant implementation of the programming
language Scheme.  The regexp notation supported is
compatible with Perl's, and includes such
powerful directives as 

* numeric quantifiers
* non-greedy quantifiers
* POSIX character classes
* non-capturing clusters (in addition to the usual 
    capturing kind)
* selective (ie, per-cluster) case-insensitivity
* selective space-insensitivity (with provision 
    for comments)
* backreferences
* alternation
* backtrack pruning
* lookahead (positive and negative)
* lookbehind (positive and negative)

This is in addition to the more basic directives
familiar to all regexp users.

To use, simply load the file `pregexp.scm' into your
Scheme.  Alternatively, if your dialect allows it, you
can install pregexp as a module -- consult the
file `INSTALL'.

However you load pregexp, you will now have
access to the procedures

* pregexp
* pregexp-match-positions
* pregexp-match
* pregexp-split
* pregexp-replace
* pregexp-replace*

The use of these procedures is described fully and with
examples in the pregexp manual.  

pregexp.cl is a machine-translation of
pregexp.scm that runs in Common Lisp.

The pregexp distribution with documentation may be
downloaded from a link provided in the pregexp manual
on the World Wide Web at
`http://www.ccs.neu.edu/~dorai/pregexp/pregexp.html'.
