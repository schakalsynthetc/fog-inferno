## fish shell for inferno

## fiqh squeak/morphic and web/httpd

needs wires for the squeak version

android webview app for the fiqh world

think about unifying the wire protocol over squeak/httpd

login and permissions for http wire (should be consistent with squeak wire)

fiqh web ui for fix tree navigator and text file editing, acme backcompatible

fiqh leaf context is the wdir, the open file in it, the fish process context

fiqh/fix/fish working directory is object is fith image

web ui can keep this whole context client-side, think about javascript proxying (Qt,Qr)

assign Qids to DOM elements on the page

DOM document is wdir/obj/image
document lifetimes correspond to fish shell process lifetimes
 
# t ## unit vector map verb form point leaf tree alphabet verb wire

((x /live/ y) (leaf session track clip take))

## fith wire #
	/b/dis/Inferno/c/wire.b
first five arguments

a file with '#!/!' called with no arguments walks to itself
a file /path/  '#!/left/!' -> '#!/!' walks to left and evals left on itself
a file '#!/! left' does the same

if <path> is '#!/! <path>' then commutative self-evaluating

/path/thing <index> <verb> <argv>
/usr/jkl/guide 192 fee foo

## acme stuff #
clean tags so that b2 on the whole tag can make sense
tag is t, body is 0
let dir windows form a nice ls with t (or guide)

(actually, invoke <dir>/t to do it with a verb)
	call of /dir/t /dir/t will do it (consulting 'w' for display form)
		/usr/jkl/t w/acme/2

##/w/# window system
		
/usr/jkl/img/foo w/something/w see
 :init: /fiqh/img/t /usr/jkl/img/foo w/something/w : walk :0:see; quit
/usr/jkl/img/foo w/something/w
 :init: /fiqh/img/t /usr/jkl/img/foo w/something/w : walk quit

calling a file with just '#!/!' clones it
calling '/! <path>' consults 'absent', clones <path>, creating if it doesn't exist
writing just '#!/!' to a file then exec'ing it is identically 'clone'
we can see if files need to be cloned by checking if the whole contents is '#!/!'
clone a whole leaf by '#!/!' then leaf on stdin
the clone can be a file that becomes a leaf when exec'd?

fish shell understands calling a directory as calling its 't' (or wire).

## t t ! ( ! ... ! ) #

/!( /00/00/00/00/00000000/00000000/t 
    /00/00/00/00/00000000/00000000/t 
    /00/00/00/00/00000000/00000000/! 
  ( /00/00/00/00/00000000/00000000/00000000 (foo bar blorp) ))

##/y/# 

aggregated from a list of locations.
y/<path>/ goes to the first occuring location that has it.
  if the tree y/<path>/ already exists then
    if leftl and thisl are identical then do nothing to y/<path>/
    otherwise y/<path>/l/<thisl>/ is <path> as extant on thisl.
tree sync across locations using y/<path>/l
trees that work similarly
