#!/! /fix/d/modular

every 9p operation is dispatched to a dis module specified at init time.

the modules get the qid of the file and can further dispatch to an operation module specific to the file's type (as determined by the qid).

default calls are performed by a stack of modules, allowing the fs to layer features.

## feature modules
### network backing store: writes are forwarded to a backing store server
### advanced permissions: stat and wstat consult a service
### proxied files and directories: for host fs, fiqh image, http service, etc

iofile command serves a file calling out to a reader/writer module
iodir command serves a dir with walk, open, close, stat, wstat modules
