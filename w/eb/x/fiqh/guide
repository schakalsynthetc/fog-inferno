if <path> has a match under /x/fiqh/e/<path> 
then window is under direction of that leaf

## httpd #

called as GET /x/fiqh/<path> ? <alphabet>
	:w: which window to use ;
	
	:e: consider it an object of type <path> ;
	:f: presentation form ;
	
	:x: do a verb here ;
	:i: assume identity ;
		authenticated i has access to owned filesystem
	:l: assume location ;
		this may direct where programs run
	:r: reference context ;
		where href is inferred from
	:q: qid of leaf ;
		web service reserves /q/00/00/00
	:p: pid of an extant fish process ;
		none means allocate a fresh one
	:b: runtime platform of client side ;
		normally browser, html5, javascript
		but can be anything we can define
	:c: language for client side ;
		normally javascript but etc
	:a: language and object context ;
		normally javascript but etc
		
/x/httpd/fiqh -> /x/fiqh/x

/x/httpd/fiqh :
	is a dis module
	verifies request is proper
	checks identity credentials
	spawns the fish
		makes the ramfs and chans tree for it
	waits for /x/fiqh/x to return and 
		tears everything down when it does
/x/fiqh/x :
	is an sh script
	determines the namespace
	
	does { indexicals=(i l p q a b c r);
		{for (t in $indexicals) if {no $t} {t=00/00/00}
	};

	sees the fish indexically in its namespace
	and the fiqh leaf
	signals to /x/httpd/fiqh when it quits
		so the fish either hangs up or hangs around
