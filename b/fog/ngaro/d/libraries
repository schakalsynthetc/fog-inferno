# Libraries

## Overview
Retro includes numerous optional libraries that extend the core language in
useful ways.

Libraries marked as *stable* will be frozen with the first release candidate.
When frozen, new functionality may be added, but existing functionality must
not be removed or altered (except to fix bugs).
