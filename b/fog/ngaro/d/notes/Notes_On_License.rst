Overview of Retro's License
===========================

Background
----------

Traditionally, Retro has been released as *public domain*. In more recent times,
with the increase in contributions from users outside the United States, this
has lead to questions as most countries do not recognize the ability of an author
to give up copyright protection on his work. Further study implies that even in
the USA, outside of works developed by the government, it may not be possible to
give up copyright protection.

For this reason, we have released the current generation of Retro under the
*ISC License*, which offers as much freedom as possible. Basically the only
requirement is that you leave any copyright statements and license file in the
source code.

You are free to use any license you like for your own code, but contributions
submitted for inclusion with Retro will be placed under this license. (As an
exception, libraries submitted can be under other licenses, but this must be
marked in the source files and any included documentation on them so users of
Retro can be aware of any potential legal issues with specific libraries)
