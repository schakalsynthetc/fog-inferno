#/x/venti

## types

Vhid { t object index [hash [h1 h2 h3 h4]] }

p: object this block is a member of 
q: this block's index in its object

hash is five words (20 bytes) 

(Qid [13] path,version,type) + rune + byte = Xt

A 64 line pairs a Vhid to a Qid with room for one more Xt

(ixlist: t, pointer, index, tail)
