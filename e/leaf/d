any /leaf/<type>/ has 'fith,fog,fix,fish,fiqh' subtypes


## leaf #

If the leaf type has an index function, numbered files will be the
elements on the medium, otherwise numbered files are byte offsets.

	p holds all active cursors.
	q is the index.
	r is the map.

## type #

	/fix/leaf/T/q/Q/t : index type Q for leaf type T ;
	/fix/leaf/T/r/R/t : map type R for leaf type T ;

(T may be null.)

These type descriptors are the shebang of the leaf's p,q,r files.
