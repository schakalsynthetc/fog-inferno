# /fog/inferno ## the approximate current state of things ##

disorderly summary dump of my various inferno roots aggregated from my various machines, slightly cleaned up. for now the plan is just to start pushing things back up here if and when they seem worth sharing -- things herein may or may not even run outside of my private context but certainly aren't guaranteed to make much sense outside of it even if they do. aim to change that eventually but for now at least there's something here.
